## MIPS Assembly Language

  - Using ```QtSpim```, this course studied ```MIPS assembly language```. Topics included initialising variables, accepting user input, addition, and a rudimentary understanding of binary analysis of MIPS architecture instructions. Logic and shift operations, branch and jump instructions, and ```floating point instructions``` were also discussed.
  
  - Additionally, we discussed loops, arrays, load/store instructions, and string manipulation. We looked into functions and recursion in MIPS further. We also comprehended ```memory allocation using system calls``` and the mapping of structures.
  
  - Then, we used MIPS to implement several ```sorting algorithms```, including bubble sort, merge sort, heap sort, etc. Additionally, we wrote MIPS Assembly language code for ```graph algorithms``` like bfs and dfs.

## Important Notes

#### Functions
```c
$a0,$a1,$a2 // are used for passing parameters to functions
$v0 $v1 // are used to return values
$sp // is stack pointer
```

#### Structure in MIPS

```c
typedef struct node{
  int val; //value of this node
  struct node * left; //pointer to left child
  struct node* right; //pointer to right child
} nodeType;
```

#### C equivalent

```c
// a, b, c, ptr are analogous to values of $s0, $s1, $s2, $v0 respectively.

node* ptr = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

ptr->val = a; // $s0 has the value
ptr->left = b; // $s1 has left pointer
ptr->right = c; // $s2 has right pointer

a = ptr->val;
b= ptr->left;
c = ptr->right;
```

#### MIPS assembly
```c
// After syscall, $v0 points to 12 bytes of free memory (newly allocated)

li $a0,12 //bytes to be allocated
li $v0,9 //sbrk code is 9
syscall //now $v0 holds the address of first byte of 12 bytes of free memory

sw $s0, 0($v0)
sw $s1, 4($v0)
sw $s2, 8($v0)

lw $s0, 0($v0)
lw $s1, 4($v0)
lw $s2, 8($v0)
```
