## MIPS Assembly Language

  - Using ```QtSpim```, this course studied ```MIPS assembly language```. Topics included initialising variables, accepting user input, addition, and a rudimentary understanding of binary analysis of MIPS architecture instructions. Logic and shift operations, branch and jump instructions, and ```floating point instructions``` were also discussed.
  
  - Additionally, we discussed loops, arrays, load/store instructions, and string manipulation. We looked into functions and recursion in MIPS further. We also comprehended ```memory allocation using system calls``` and the mapping of structures.
  
  - Then, we used MIPS to implement several ```sorting algorithms```, including bubble sort, merge sort, heap sort, etc. Additionally, we wrote MIPS Assembly language code for ```graph algorithms``` like bfs and dfs.
